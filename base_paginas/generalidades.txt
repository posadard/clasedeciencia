Project Name

The Green Chemicalstore Almanac — a simple, fast, SEO-optimized online magazine of publications with sections, filters, and references to SDS PDFs and ChemicalStore products.

Purpose & Goals

• Publish short, practical articles and references (dictionary, tables, essentials).
• Organize content by section and support multi-facet filters per section.
• Optimize every article for SEO, GEO, and schema.org.
• Drive traffic to ChemicalStore.com with consistent UTM parameters.
• Keep Safety as an external SDS list (sds.chemicalstore.com).
• Keep Issues as a simple Contact page to email office@chemicalstore.com
.

Audience

General homestead/farming users (including Amish/Mennonite communities) seeking plain-language chemistry guidance with low-bandwidth pages and printable layouts.

Scope (MVP)

• Static or lightly dynamic site with: Home, Library (catalog of publications with filters), Section pages, Article pages, Dictionary A-Z, Essentials, Safety (external), Issues (Contact), About/Contact, Terms/Privacy, Sitemap.
• Admin/authoring via a lightweight CMS or static content repo.
• No user accounts, no payments on this domain.

Non-Goals (MVP)

• No complex e-commerce.
• No heavy client-side frameworks required.
• No comment system.
• No complex faceted counts (approximate filtering is acceptable).

Information Architecture (Frontend)

Header (global): Sections nav + Search.
Sidebar (per listing): Filters for Section, Tags, Season, Chemicals, Difficulty, Format, Issue/Year.
Content area: Card/grid of publications.
Footer (basic): About, Contact, Terms, Privacy, Sitemap.

Filtering Logic (Server-Side)

Read GET params and filter posts by exact Section, AND-logic on multiple tags/chemicals (configurable to OR if needed).

Sort by published_at DESC, with optional featured override.

Pagination by page param.

All filters reflected in URL (shareable, crawlable).

SQL-like pseudo

WHERE p.status='published'
AND (:section IS NULL OR p.section_id=:section)
AND (:difficulty IS NULL OR p.difficulty=:difficulty)
AND (:issue IS NULL OR p.issue_id=:issue)
AND (:format_list IS NULL OR p.format IN (:format_list))
AND (:tags IS NULL OR t.slug IN (:tags))
AND (:chems IS NULL OR c.slug IN (:chems))
GROUP BY p.id
HAVING
  (:tags IS NULL OR COUNT(DISTINCT t.slug FILTER (WHERE t.slug IN (:tags))) = :tags_count)
AND
  (:chems IS NULL OR COUNT(DISTINCT c.slug FILTER (WHERE c.slug IN (:chems))) = :chems_count)
ORDER BY p.published_at DESC
LIMIT :limit OFFSET :offset;

SEO / GEO / Schema.org (Technical Minimum)

• Unique <title> and <meta name="description"> per page.
• rel="canonical" on articles and listings.
• hreflang if adding Spanish later (/es/).
• OpenGraph/Twitter tags for sharable cards.
• sitemap.xml includes home, sections, paginated listings, articles, dictionary, essentials, issues.
• robots.txt allows crawling, blocks /admin.
• JSON-LD:

Article for articles

HowTo for step-by-step content

ItemList for listing pages

Product (minimal) for Essentials linking to ChemicalStore
• GEO meta (optional): default country/region in global layout; override per article if local.

External Integrations

• Safety: link out to https://sds.chemicalstore.com/ (no mirror).
• Issues (Contact): either mailto:office@chemicalstore.com or a small /api/contact endpoint that relays via SMTP.
• ChemicalStore traffic: all outbound product links append UTM defaults:

utm_source=thegreenalmanac&utm_medium=referral&utm_campaign={context}

Performance & Accessibility

• Static generation (SSG) recommended; HTML first, minimal JS.
• Monochrome theme, high contrast; print CSS for articles/dictionary/tables.
• Images pre-scaled and lazy-loaded; no heavy libraries.

Suggested Tech Stack (MVP)

• Static site: Eleventy or Astro (SSG) OR Next.js (SSG).
• Content storage: Markdown/MDX with front-matter; optional Decap/Netlify CMS.
• Hosting/CDN: Netlify, Vercel, or Cloudflare Pages.
• Optional serverless functions: /api/contact.

Acceptance Criteria (MVP)

Library and Section listings accept server-side filters via GET params; URLs are shareable.

Each article renders valid JSON-LD (Article; HowTo when applicable).

Essentials pages render minimal Product JSON-LD and include outbound links to ChemicalStore with UTM.

Safety page links to https://sds.chemicalstore.com/.

Issues page allows contacting office@chemicalstore.com (mailto or function).

Sitemap and robots are generated; pages pass basic Lighthouse SEO checks.

Print styles produce clean black-and-white prints for Article and Dictionary pages.

Pages load fast on low bandwidth; no JS required to read content or navigate filters.
