    is a dry cell. A chemical reaction between the electrolyte and

    <P><font face="Verdana" size="2">I experimented by testing the power of four different brands
    of batteries. I did this by hooking up the batteries to a light
    bulb. I then kept track of the length of time each bulb stayed
    lit. I tested two batteries from each of the four brands.</font></TD>

    <H3><font face="Verdana" size="2">Results</font></H3>

    <P><font face="Verdana" size="2">After the testing was completed the following results were
    recorded: The Duracell battery lasted the longest, 101 hours
    and 20 minutes; Energizer battery, second, 99 hours and 17 minutes;
    Eveready battery, third, 28 hours and 30 minutes, and last but
    not least was the BA 30 batteries, 25 hours ad 58 minutes.</font></TD>

    <H3><font face="Verdana" size="2">Conclusion</font></H3>

    <P><font face="Verdana" size="2">I thought the Duracell battery would last the longest. I guessed
    right! It was two hours and 3 minutes longer than the Energizer.
    I also determined that the cost of the battery does relate to
    the amount of battery power.</font></TD>

    <H3><font face="Verdana" size="2"><I>How did I come up with my project idea?</I></font></H3>

    <P><font face="Verdana" size="2">My dad and I were getting ready to go on a 
	boundary waters
    canoe trip and we were debating on what kind of batteries to
    purchase for our flashlights. We wanted ones with a lot of power.
    So I thought that would be a good science fair experiment.</font></P>

    <H3><font face="Verdana" size="2"><I>What did I learn from my experiment?</I></font></H3>

    <P><font face="Verdana" size="2">I learned that science fair projects are a lot of hard work.
    The most powerful battery of the four I tested was Duracell.
    It also was the most expensive.</font></P>

    <H3><font face="Verdana" size="2"><I>How close were my hypothesis and conclusion?</I></font></H3>

    <P><font face="Verdana" size="2">I guessed that Duracell would last the longest and I was right.
    It was also the most expensive.</font></P>

    <H3><font face="Verdana" size="2"><I>Did I learn anything new from my project?</I></font></H3>

    <P><font face="Verdana" size="2">Yes I learned through this experiment that if you buy a more
    expensive battery you get a more powerful battery.</font></P>

    <H3><font face="Verdana" size="2"><I>What was the most interesting part of my project?</I></font></H3>

    <P><font face="Verdana" size="2">It was when my hypothesis and conclusion matched.</font><div align="center">
