    <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="+1">State the Problem:</FONT><BR>
    What foods or vegetables contain starch?</P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="+1">Research the Problem:</FONT><BR>
    Before we start, we need to know more about starch. Studies show
    that starch is white, odorless, tasteless carbohydrate powder
    soluble in cold water. This information will help us extract
    starch from our samples for more accurate tests. If we have any
    colorful fruit or vegetables for test, we can eliminate the chance
    of mixed colors and inaccurate tests. Starch also plays a vital
    role in the biochemistry of both plants and animals. It is made
    in green plants by photosynthesis, and is one of the main forms
    in which plants store food. Animals obtain starch from plants
    and store it as glycogen. Both plants and animals convert starch
    to glucose when energy is needed. Commercially, starch is made
    chiefly from corn and potatoe.</P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="+1">Hypothesis:</FONT><BR>
    Starch is a substance in most fruits and vegetables, which means
    that it is most likely in the vegetable and fruit samples. Since
    starch is an inexpensive and widely available food product, it
    is being used as a food additive in many food products.</P>

    <P><FONT COLOR="#0000ff" SIZE="+1">Experiment:</FONT></P>

    <P>In order to perform this project, we must use Iodine solution
    as a reagent for starch. One drop of this solution on any sample
    can detect starch by changing the color of the tested area to
    dark blue.<BR>
    We will be using the following samples:</P>

    <P>Procedure: We crush the wet samples, add cold or room temperature
    water and filter the solution to get a clear liquid. Next, test
    the samples of the clear liquid for starch and record the result.</P>
