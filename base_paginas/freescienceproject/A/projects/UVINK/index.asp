        (Initial
        Observation)
        </FONT></B></P>

        <P><font face="Verdana" size="2">Invisible ink refers to any substance
        which can be used to write with, which is either invisible on
        application or disappears quickly, and can be subsequently restored by
        some means. The use of invisible ink is a form of steganography, and has
        been used in espionage.&nbsp;<br>
        The simplest forms of invisible ink are lemon juice and milk. Write on
        paper with a fountain pen, toothpick or a finger dipped in the liquid.
        Once dry, the paper appears blank. The writing is made to appear by
        heating the paper, on a hot radiator for example. Invisible inks have
        been used for secrecy and security for many years.&nbsp;</font></P>

        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The Germans in World War II used
        invisible inks for secret writings. One suspected spy was found to have
        large numbers of keys in his motel room. After inspecting the keys it
        was found that some of the keys were modified to unscrew at the top to
        show a plastic nib. The keys contained special chemicals for invisible
        ink! However, codes and secret ink messages were very easily captured
        and decoded.<br>
        <br>
        Some of the more fun secret writings are concealment messages like
        invisible inks made out of potato juice, lemon juice, and other types of
        juices and sugars! Deciphering and decoding messages take a lot of time
        and can be very frustrating. With experience, strategies, and most of
        all luck, you'll be able to crack lots of codes and ciphers.&nbsp;</font></p>

        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Fluorescent invisible inks:</b> A
        substance used as a fluorescent invisible ink is usually a clear liquid.
        You may use a fluorescent invisible ink to write any thing on paper or
        almost any other surface. You know what you write, but others cannot see
        it. A UV light can magically make your writing visible. Most invisible
        inks can be revealed only once and remain visible for the life of the
        document. Fluorescent invisible inks however can be revealed as many
        times as you need under UV light. They will disappear again as soon as
        you turn off the UV light. This gives a special advantage to fluorescent
        invisible lights and opens the doors to many new applications for such
        invisible inks.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Modern Applications:</b> Invisible
        fluorescent inks are use to to mark dollar bills and many other valuable
        documents to prevent counterfeiting. Banks and inspectors of such
        documents use UV lights to see the hidden marks in order to verify
        legitimacy of documents. Invisible fluorescent inks are also used to
        mark other valuable properties for identification and to proof ownership
        in case of theft. Invisible fluorescent powders and inks are used to
        detect unauthorized access and theft. These material will remain on
        hands and clothing of the thief and are viewable under UV light. Clubs
        and museums are using invisible inks to stamp visitors hands and use it
        to control re-entry.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>More about UV light:</b> UV or Ultra
        Violet is an invisible part of light spectrum above blue. UV has a
        higher frequency (lower wavelength) than visible lights. Although
        invisible, UV has many of the properties of normal sunlight. UV can
        cause sunburn, hurt the eyes and even cause discoloration of material
        dyed with organic dyes.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Ultra violet light sources can be used
        at the crime scene or in the laboratory for the visualization of several
        types of physical/trace evidence. Many human physiological fluids such
        as blood, semen, saliva and urine may fluoresce under ultraviolet light
        sources.<br>
        Other items such as hairs, fibers, latent fingerprints and even footwear
        impressions may fluoresce. Examination may also reveal bruising,
        physiological stains and marks which may not be evident under normal
        lighting.<br>
        (Warning: UV light can damage your retina if the light source is viewed
        directly.)&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2"><b>Forensic Investigation using UV
        light:</b></font></p>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Since body fluids like semen, saliva,
        and vaginal fluids are naturally fluorescent, the use of a light source
        offers a unique method for locating them. A crime scene investigator can
        narrow down the specific locations of stains for collection instead of
        testing entire, large pieces of evidence such as a mattress, a carpet, a
        sheet, an article of clothing, etc. The dried body fluids will actually
        glow under the UV light illumination.</font></p>

        to test each hypothesis. Make a step-by-step list of what you
        will do to answer each question. This list is called an experimental
        procedure. For an experiment to give answers you can trust, it
        must have a &quot;control.&quot; A control is an additional experimental
        trial or run. It is a separate experiment, done exactly like
        the others. The only difference is that no experimental variables
        are changed. A control is a neutral &quot;reference point&quot;
        for comparison that allows you to see what changing a variable
        does by comparing it to not changing anything. Dependable controls
        are sometimes very hard to develop. They can be the hardest part
        of a project. Without a control you cannot be sure that changing
        the variable causes your observations. A series of experiments
        that includes a control is called a &quot;controlled experiment.&quot;</font>

        done in series. A series of experiments can be done by changing
        one variable a different amount each time. A series of experiments
        is made up of separate experimental &quot;runs.&quot; During
        each run you make a measurement of how much the variable affected
        the system under study. For each run, a different amount of change
        in the variable is used. This produces a different amount of
        response in the system. You measure this response, or record
        data, in a table for this purpose. This is considered &quot;raw
        data&quot; since it has not been processed or interpreted yet.
        When raw data gets processed mathematically, for example, it

        about the system under study. These conclusions help us confirm
        or deny our original hypothesis. Often, mathematical equations

        how a change will affect the system without the need to do additional

        </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you did not observe
        anything different than what happened with your control, the

        If you did not observe a consistent, reproducible trend in your
        series of experimental runs there may be experimental errors
        affecting your results. The first thing to check is how you are
        making your measurements. Is the measurement method questionable
        or unreliable? Maybe you are reading a scale incorrectly, or
        maybe the measuring instrument is working erratically.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you determine that experimental
        errors are influencing your results, carefully rethink the design
        of your experiments. Review each step of the procedure to find
        sources of potential errors. If possible, have a scientist review
        the procedure with you. Sometimes the designer of an experiment
