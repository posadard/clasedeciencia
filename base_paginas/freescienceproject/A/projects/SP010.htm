        </FONT></B><font face="Verdana" color="#9933FF" size="1">Design an experiment
        to test each hypothesis. Make a step-by-step list of what you
        will do to answer each question. This list is called an experimental
        procedure. For an experiment to give answers you can trust, it
        must have a &quot;control.&quot; A control is an additional experimental
        trial or run. It is a separate experiment, done exactly like
        the others. The only difference is that no experimental variables
        are changed. A control is a neutral &quot;reference point&quot;
        for comparison that allows you to see what changing a variable
        does by comparing it to not changing anything. Dependable controls
        are sometimes very hard to develop. They can be the hardest part
        of a project. Without a control you cannot be sure that changing
        the variable causes your observations. A series of experiments
        that includes a control is called a &quot;controlled experiment.&quot;</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Scientific (programmable) calculators
        should be accurate! Here are a few ways to determine their accuracy and
        some results. Naturally, if you test a calculator not mentioned here, I
        am eager to learn the results you get: Please e-mail.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">One way to test the accuracy of a
        scientific calculator is to perform the following formula and see when
        the answer turns out to be ONE (1).</font>
        <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Y =lim ( X / sin X)
        where X descends to zero.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">If Y is 1 upon X = 0.01 then the
        accuracy will be classified ´low´.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Simular with X = 0.001, accuracy will
        be ´below normal´.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">With X = 0.0001, accuracy ´normal´. X
        = 0.00001, accuracy ´good´. X = 0.000001, accuracy ´very good´. X =
        0.0000001 or smaller, accuracy ´extremely good´.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">A few examples of calculators I have
        that are still in working order: The TI-57 and TI-25 score NORMAL. The
        TI-58, HP-33E, FX-502P and FX-6000G score GOOD. The HP-48SX scores VERY
        GOOD and the TI-92 scores EXTREMELY GOOD.</font>
        <hr width="100%" SIZE="4">
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">Another way to test the accuracy is to
        see how many digits will be correct (or give a correct rounded result)
        for the following calculations:</font>
        <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Cos 0.184 (rad) =
        0.983119705665017</font>
        <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Sin 3.8° (deg) =
        0.066273900400000</font>
        <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Atn 0.445 (rad) =
        0.418688151438</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The TI-57 scores 7, 7, 7 digits.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The FX-6000G scores 10, 10, 10 digits.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The HP-33E scores 10, 11, 10 digits.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The FX-502P scores 11, 11, 11 digits.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The TI-58 scores 12, 10, 12 digits.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The HP-48SX scores 12, 11, 12 digits.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">The TI-92 scores 14, 14, 12 digits.</font>
        <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">Of course the number of
        accurate digits never exceeds the number of digits used by the
        calculator internally. Digits that are not shown by the display can be
        made visible by subtracting the visible result. For example: The TI-92
        gives the following result for Cos 0.184 (rad): 0.983119705665. If we
        subtract 0.983119705665 from this answer we will see the remaining
        digits: 2 E -14. Put together the result is 0.98311970566502, which is a
        correct (be it rounded) result for all 14 digits.</font>
        <p align="center"><font face="Verdana" size="2">(Of course, on the TI-92
        there is an easier way to see the full 14 digits of the result, but that
        is beside the point here.)</font></p>

        <h2><font face="Verdana" size="2">A Simple Accuracy Test for Calculators</font></h2>
        <font face="Verdana" size="2">Back in the early days of handheld
        calculators the 'Commodore' test was a simple demonstration of
        trigonometric accuracy. It was invented by the Commodore Business
        Machines (CBM) marketing department to highlight the accuracy of their
        machines. Althought it only tests a few functions, over the years it has
        proven a useful way to get a 'feel' for the overall accuracy of
        calculators.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">At the time the test appeared in CBM
        adverts good machines would return values a few thousands of a
        percentage out while there were some machines on the market which would
        be a few <em>percent</em> in error. (Yes, I owned a Sinclair Oxford
        300!) Nowadays it is unusual to find a machine that is more than a
        billionth of percent in error.</font>
        <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">To test a calculator set it to work in
        degrees and then enter the following calculation:</font>
        <pre><font face="Verdana" size="2">      asin(acos(atan(tan(cos(sin(29))))))
    </font></pre>
        <font face="Verdana" size="2">which <em>should</em> return a value of
        '29'. To get the percentage error carry out the following calculation:</font>
        <pre><font face="Verdana" size="2">      (asin(acos(atan(tan(cos(sin(29))))))-29)/29*100</font></pre>

        done in series. A series of experiments can be done by changing
        one variable a different amount each time. A series of experiments
        is made up of separate experimental &quot;runs.&quot; During
        each run you make a measurement of how much the variable affected
        the system under study. For each run, a different amount of change
        in the variable is used. This produces a different amount of
        response in the system. You measure this response, or record
        data, in a table for this purpose. This is considered &quot;raw
        data&quot; since it has not been processed or interpreted yet.
        When raw data gets processed mathematically, for example, it
        becomes results.</FONT></TD>

        about the system under study. These conclusions help us confirm
        or deny our original hypothesis. Often, mathematical equations
        can be made from graphs. These equations allow us to predict
        how a change will affect the system without the need to do additional
        experiments. Advanced levels of experimental science rely heavily
        on graphical and mathematical analysis of data. At this level,
        science becomes even more interesting and powerful.</FONT></TD>

        </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you did not observe

        If you did not observe a consistent, reproducible trend in your
        series of experimental runs there may be experimental errors
        affecting your results. The first thing to check is how you are
        making your measurements. Is the measurement method questionable
        or unreliable? Maybe you are reading a scale incorrectly, or
        maybe the measuring instrument is working erratically.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you determine that experimental
        errors are influencing your results, carefully rethink the design
        of your experiments. Review each step of the procedure to find
        sources of potential errors. If possible, have a scientist review
        the procedure with you. Sometimes the designer of an experiment
