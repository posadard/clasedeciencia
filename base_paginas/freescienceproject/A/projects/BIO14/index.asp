        <p><b>Respiratory System</b></p>
        <p>Stomata</p>
        <p><b>Description</b></p>
        <p>Plants need to breathe, too! Just like our cells, the cells in a
        plant are working hard, and need energy. Plants need oxygen to get the
        energy out of the food they make. Obviously, plants don't have lungs or
        gills, so how do they breathe? They breathe through special little holes
        on the underside of their leaves called <b>stomata</b>.</p>
        <p><img height="150" alt hspace="10" src="stomata.jpg" width="217" align="right" vspace="5" border="0">
        The stomata allow fresh air to enter the leaf, where the plant's cells
        can take out the oxygen. When the oxygen is used up, the air can flow
        back outside through the stomata again.</p>
        <p><b>Neat Stuff</b></p>
        <p><img height="108" alt hspace="10" src="flower.gif" width="120" align="right" vspace="5" border="0">
        Plants have special cells surrounding the stomata called <b>guard cells</b>.
        The guard cells can squeeze over the opening, to close up the hole. This
        is useful when it's very dry out, and the plant doesn't want to lose any
        water through the stomata. It's also useful as a defense against small
        insects, which can sometimes crawl through the opening and into the
        leaf.</p>

        <p class="normalbold">Stomata Counts and Pollution</p>
        <p class="normal"><font color="#990000">Stomata Count Differences of
        Selected Coniferous Trees<br>
        Spencer Larson, 12, Springville, Utah<br>
        Finalist, Discovery Channel Young Scientist Challenge, 2003</font>
        <p class="normal"><font color="#990000">Project background:</font>
        Spencer's inspiration for his project came from articles he read in <em>National
        Geographic</em> as well as his established interest in trees. This led
        him to wonder if stomata counts differ within a geographical region as a
        direct effect of pollution. Stomata are tiny openings or pores in the
        surface of plant leaves. They allow gases and water vapor to pass into
        and out of a plant.
        <p class="normal"><font color="#990000">Tactics and results:</font>
        Spencer collected Douglas fir and pinyon pine tree samples from Hobble
        Creek Canyon and a park in Provo, Utah. He calculated pollution levels
        by monitoring the number of cars that passed each site over the course
        of four 1-hour periods.
        <p class="normal">After determining the number of stomata on each of the
        samples, Spencer discovered that pollution does in fact affect the
        stomata count and may be used as a marker to indicate variations in
        pollution levels.</p>

        to test each hypothesis. Make a step-by-step list of what you
        will do to answer each question. This list is called an experimental
        procedure. For an experiment to give answers you can trust, it
        must have a &quot;control.&quot; A control is an additional experimental
        trial or run. It is a separate experiment, done exactly like
        the others. The only difference is that no experimental variables
        are changed. A control is a neutral &quot;reference point&quot;
        for comparison that allows you to see what changing a variable
        does by comparing it to not changing anything. Dependable controls
        are sometimes very hard to develop. They can be the hardest part
        of a project. Without a control you cannot be sure that changing
        the variable causes your observations. A series of experiments
        that includes a control is called a &quot;controlled experiment.&quot;</font>

        done in series. A series of experiments can be done by changing
        one variable a different amount each time. A series of experiments
        is made up of separate experimental &quot;runs.&quot; During
        each run you make a measurement of how much the variable affected
        the system under study. For each run, a different amount of change
        in the variable is used. This produces a different amount of
        response in the system. You measure this response, or record
        data, in a table for this purpose. This is considered &quot;raw
        data&quot; since it has not been processed or interpreted yet.
        When raw data gets processed mathematically, for example, it
        becomes results.</FONT></TD>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It is from calculations using
        recorded data that tables and graphs are made. Studying tables
        and graphs, we can see trends that tell us how different variables
        cause our observations. Based on these trends, we can draw conclusions
        about the system under study. These conclusions help us confirm
        or deny our original hypothesis. Often, mathematical equations
        can be made from graphs. These equations allow us to predict
        how a change will affect the system without the need to do additional
        experiments. Advanced levels of experimental science rely heavily
        on graphical and mathematical analysis of data. At this level,
        science becomes even more interesting and powerful.</FONT></TD>

        Errors:<BR>
        </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you did not observe
        anything different than what happened with your control, the
        variable you changed may not affect the system you are investigating.
        If you did not observe a consistent, reproducible trend in your
        series of experimental runs there may be experimental errors
        affecting your results. The first thing to check is how you are
        making your measurements. Is the measurement method questionable
        or unreliable? Maybe you are reading a scale incorrectly, or
        maybe the measuring instrument is working erratically.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you determine that experimental
        errors are influencing your results, carefully rethink the design
        of your experiments. Review each step of the procedure to find
        sources of potential errors. If possible, have a scientist review
        the procedure with you. Sometimes the designer of an experiment
        can miss the obvious.</FONT></TD>
