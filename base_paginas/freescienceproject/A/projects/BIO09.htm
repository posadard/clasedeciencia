        to test each hypothesis. Make a step-by-step list of what you
        will do to answer each question. This list is called an experimental
        procedure. For an experiment to give answers you can trust, it
        must have a &quot;control.&quot; A control is an additional experimental
        trial or run. It is a separate experiment, done exactly like
        the others. The only difference is that no experimental variables
        are changed. A control is a neutral &quot;reference point&quot;
        for comparison that allows you to see what changing a variable
        does by comparing it to not changing anything. Dependable controls
        are sometimes very hard to develop. They can be the hardest part
        of a project. Without a control you cannot be sure that changing
        the variable causes your observations. A series of experiments
        that includes a control is called a &quot;controlled experiment.&quot;</font>

        </table>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">In order to grow bacteria, you will
        need culture media, plates or petri-dishes and some laboratory supplies
        and incubator.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Culture Media:</b> Culture media is
        a moist or liquid matter that contains nutrients for bacteria. Almost
        any nutrient food may be considered a culture media for general
        bacteria, however if you want to grow a specific bacteria or prevent
        growing some other bacteria, you will need to use a fine tuned recipe
        for your culture media.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Chicken broth and beef broth are among
        nutrients that most bacteria like. In some recipes you may also add some
        mushroom extract. Sugar can also be added to most culture media. Small
        amounts of some minerals such as potassium phosphate and calcium
        carbonate may also be added to the culture media. Note that there are
        many foods that are good for growing bacteria, but they are not good as
        culture media. For example bacteria can easily grow on milk, but milk is
        not a good culture media because it will change by the activity of
        bacteria. Part of milk will solidifies when bacteria produce acids. A
        good culture media must be clear and must remain liquid and should not
        easily change pH. If we need to solidify our culture media, we use agar
        to do that. Agar is a gelatinous substance that is extracted from sea
        weeds. If we need to grow bacteria for the purpose of identification or
        counting, we need to grow bacteria in nutrient agar plates. These are
        petri-dishes containing a mixture of agar and nutrients.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Peteri-dishes:</b> Petri-dishes are
        disposable clear plastic dishes with a cap that are used for many
        science experiments and bacteria growth.&nbsp; A thin layer of nutrient
        agar in a petri-dish is enough for growing bacteria. You can see the
        bacteria colony shapes and count them without opening the lead of the
        petri-dish. Since petri-dishes are clear, you can see the bacteria from
        either side of the dish.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Incubator:</b> Incubator is a warm
        cabinet that you can set it's temperature to a proper temperature for
        bacteria growth. About 35º C is a good temperature for most bacteria.
        This is close the body temperature. If you be able to create such a
        temperature in any other way, it is as good as an incubator. You may
        find warm places behind your refrigerator, next to the radiator or
        inside an oven that is off.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">You may also make an incubator by
        placing a small desk lamp inside a wooden or metal box. Or you may put a
        Styrofoam cooler upside down over a desk lamp. A small lamp (15 watts)
        should be able to create enough heat to warm up a small space. Prepare
        your incubator in advance and use a thermometer to test it a day before
        starting your experiment.</font></p>

        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><font color="#0000FF">* Chicken broth
        or beef broth can be purchased from supermarkets and health food stores
        or you may make them at home. (It must be fat free). Filter paper is
        coffee filter or you may substitute it with any clean cotton
        cloth.&nbsp;</font></font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Procedure:</b></font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">If you are making your own chicken
        broth, one small chicken can give you enough broth for this experiment.
        (Half a pound beef can be used instead). Boil the chicken for one hour. Separate
        the broth by transferring it to another pot. remove any fat from the top
        of the broth. Filter the broth using a clean piece of cloth or coffee
        filter. If you are buying chicken or beef broth from a super market, it
        comes in small bags of about 4 grams each. Use two bags in about 300 ml
        water and boil it. Then filter it and transfer the filtered broth to
        another clean pan.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Add water to the broth to bring it to
        about 650 ml and boil it again. Start adding the Agar powder while stirring.&nbsp;
        (If you are using a MiniScience kit, entire agar tube must be used,
        otherwise use 8 grams of dry agar powder). You will add agar gradually
        while stirring. Adding agar will take 30 seconds to one minute. If you
        don't stir it good, agar solidifies at the bottom of the pan and burns.
        Continue stirring for another two minutes or until the agar solution is
        fully dissolved and the solution is clear.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">At this time you may optionally add a
        calcium carbonate tablet and some mushroom extract. (You could also boil
        mushroom with beef or chicken broth).</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Your nutrient agar is ready at this
        time. Turn off the heat and let it cool down. While it is still warm set
        your petri-dishes on a table. Open the lead of each petri dish and pour
        some nutrient agar in each dish (enough to cover the bottom of the dish)
        and immediately put the lead back. Repeat this for all petri-dishes.
        Leave the dishes where they are until they solidify.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>Note:</b> The nutrient agar should
        be free from all bacteria, however boiling usually is not enough to kill
        all the environmental bacteria that have entered our nutrient agar. For
        school experiments, it may not matter but in real biology laboratories,
        nutrient agar plates are transferred to an autoclave for sterilization.
        Hot, under pressure steam of autoclave can kill all bacteria in about 30
        minutes. Advanced students may use a pressure cooker to do the same.</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Use a 1 ml pipette to place 0.1 ml of
        polluted water or any other bacteria infested liquid on a dish. Spread
        the liquid all over the plate surface. Cover the plate. Turn it upside
        down and place it in an incubator. Nutrient agar will remain moist when
        the plate is upside down. Check back within 36 hours to see the result
        of bacteria growth.</font></p>

        done in series. A series of experiments can be done by changing
        one variable a different amount each time. A series of experiments
        is made up of separate experimental &quot;runs.&quot; During
        each run you make a measurement of how much the variable affected
        the system under study. For each run, a different amount of change
        in the variable is used. This produces a different amount of
        response in the system. You measure this response, or record
        data, in a table for this purpose. This is considered &quot;raw
        data&quot; since it has not been processed or interpreted yet.
        When raw data gets processed mathematically, for example, it

        how a change will affect the system without the need to do additional
        experiments. Advanced levels of experimental science rely heavily

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you determine that experimental
