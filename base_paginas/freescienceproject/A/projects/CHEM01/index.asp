        <p class="normal"><font color="#990000">Project background:</font> Zach
        and Ryker began researching antioxidants after Zach's father pointed out
        that it was a major topic of current medical research. After reading
        more, they learned that oxidation has been linked to aging and many
        diseases such as cancer and heart disease. They further discovered that
        nuts have been studied as an antioxidant source, but that not much was
        known about how different nuts compare with each other and how
        preparation methods affect their antioxidant activity. After considering
        the matter, Zach and Ryker hypothesized that nuts will prevent oxidation
        of flaxseed oil and that this effect will vary according to the type of
        nut and the roasting time.
        <p class="normal"><font color="#990000">Tactics and results:</font>
        After obtaining raw peanuts, almonds, walnuts, and pecans, Ryker and
        Zach baked groups of the peanuts and almonds at 350°F for time periods
        of 0, 5, 10, and 20 minutes. The walnuts and pecans were not roasted. To
        measure the antioxidant activity, they blended each nut sample with
        isopropyl alcohol, filtered the alcohol, and added a small amount to a
        test tube containing an aqueous copper solution and a small amount of
        flaxseed oil. They also created six control test tubes. After an
        overnight incubation, conjugated dienes were measured using a
        spectrophotometer.
        <p class="normal">Zach and Ryker's results showed that all nuts, except
        pecans, significantly prevented the oxidation of the flaxseed oil.
        Roasting for up to 10 minutes appeared to increase the antioxidant
        activity of the almonds and peanuts, but 20 minutes of roasting
        abolished the antioxidant effect.
        <p class="normal">Zach and Ryker concluded that the nuts tested, except
        pecans, did have a potent antioxidant effect and that the health
        benefits of nuts may be affected by processing methods.</p>

        to test each hypothesis. Make a step-by-step list of what you
        will do to answer each question. This list is called an experimental
        procedure. For an experiment to give answers you can trust, it
        must have a &quot;control.&quot; A control is an additional experimental
        trial or run. It is a separate experiment, done exactly like
        the others. The only difference is that no experimental variables
        are changed. A control is a neutral &quot;reference point&quot;
        for comparison that allows you to see what changing a variable
        does by comparing it to not changing anything. Dependable controls
        are sometimes very hard to develop. They can be the hardest part
        of a project. Without a control you cannot be sure that changing
        the variable causes your observations. A series of experiments
        that includes a control is called a &quot;controlled experiment.&quot;</font>

        done in series. A series of experiments can be done by changing
        one variable a different amount each time. A series of experiments
        is made up of separate experimental &quot;runs.&quot; During
        each run you make a measurement of how much the variable affected
        the system under study. For each run, a different amount of change
        in the variable is used. This produces a different amount of
        response in the system. You measure this response, or record
        data, in a table for this purpose. This is considered &quot;raw
        data&quot; since it has not been processed or interpreted yet.
        When raw data gets processed mathematically, for example, it
        becomes results.</FONT></TD>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">It is from calculations using
        recorded data that tables and graphs are made. Studying tables
        and graphs, we can see trends that tell us how different variables
        cause our observations. Based on these trends, we can draw conclusions
        about the system under study. These conclusions help us confirm
        or deny our original hypothesis. Often, mathematical equations
        can be made from graphs. These equations allow us to predict
        how a change will affect the system without the need to do additional
        experiments. Advanced levels of experimental science rely heavily
        on graphical and mathematical analysis of data. At this level,
        science becomes even more interesting and powerful.</FONT></TD>

        Errors:<BR>
        </FONT></B><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you did not observe
        anything different than what happened with your control, the
        variable you changed may not affect the system you are investigating.
        If you did not observe a consistent, reproducible trend in your
        series of experimental runs there may be experimental errors
        affecting your results. The first thing to check is how you are
        making your measurements. Is the measurement method questionable
        or unreliable? Maybe you are reading a scale incorrectly, or
        maybe the measuring instrument is working erratically.</FONT></P>

        <P><FONT SIZE="-1" FACE="Verdana">If you determine that experimental
        errors are influencing your results, carefully rethink the design
        of your experiments. Review each step of the procedure to find
        sources of potential errors. If possible, have a scientist review
        the procedure with you. Sometimes the designer of an experiment
        can miss the obvious.</FONT></TD>
