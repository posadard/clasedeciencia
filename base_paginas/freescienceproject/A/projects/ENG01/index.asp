        know what variables may be involved, think about ways to change
        one at a time. If you change more than one at a time, you will
        not know what variable is causing your observation. Sometimes
        variables are linked and work together to cause something. At

        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Variables that may affect the
        production of electricity are design variables such as size of the water
        wheel and the shape of buckets made on the wheel. Design variables
        affect the speed and torque of the wheel. On the other hand higher
        torque and speed of the water wheel, when transferred to a generator,
        produces a higher amount of electricity.</font></p>

        Design:<BR>
        </FONT></B><font face="Verdana" color="#9933FF" size="1">Design an experiment
        to test each hypothesis. Make a step-by-step list of what you
        will do to answer each question. This list is called an experimental
        procedure. For an experiment to give answers you can trust, it
        must have a &quot;control.&quot; A control is an additional experimental
        trial or run. It is a separate experiment, done exactly like
        the others. The only difference is that no experimental variables
        are changed. A control is a neutral &quot;reference point&quot;
        for comparison that allows you to see what changing a variable
        does by comparing it to not changing anything. Dependable controls
        are sometimes very hard to develop. They can be the hardest part
        of a project. Without a control you cannot be sure that changing
        the variable causes your observations. A series of experiments
        that includes a control is called a &quot;controlled experiment.&quot;</font>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">So you want to make a water wheel and
        use it's energy to run an electric generator. There are many ways that
        you can design your project. For example you may construct a wooden
        water wheel and connect it to a bicycle generator to produce
        electricity. Or you may convert an existing bicycle wheel to a water
        wheel by connecting aluminum or plastic cups to that.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">Start by drawing your design and doing
        the calculations. Imagine that you want to give your drawings to a
        builder and he is supposed to complete the project without your
        supervision or advise. Preparing the drawings and doing the calculations
        is what engineers do. So this is your chance to test your engineering
        skills.&nbsp;</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>How big should your water wheel be?</b>
        It depends on the generator that you use. The generator needs certain
        torque (rotational force) and certain rotational speed in order to
        produce electricity. Your water wheel should be able to produce enough
        force or you will get no electricity. Test your generator to see how
        much force do you need to run it efficiently and produce electricity.
        Use a volt meter to see what is the voltage produced by your generator
        at different speeds. You may use pulleys or gears to increase the
        rotational speed (Number of turns per minute).</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana"><b>How should I design the water
        wheel?</b> Here is a sample:</font></p>
        <p><font size="-1" face="Verdana">The idea is that one side of the wheel
        should hold some water and become heavy, causing the wheel to spin. As
        you know more water results more weight and more torque (rotational
        force) on the wheel.&nbsp;</font></p>

            <td width="56%"><font size="2" face="Verdana">I decided to make my
              drawings and see how much water do the cups hold in different
              designs.&nbsp;</font>
              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">In first design I will use two
              wooden circles with the diameter of two feet and a wooden cylinder

              <p><font size="2" face="Verdana">I will mount the circles on the
              bases of cylinder to make spool. I will then use 12 pieces of 6 x
              10 wood paddles to make the cups or buckets. Since water level is
              horizontal, I can see how much water does the wheel hold in one
              side in my drawings.</font></td>

              So I cam up with a second design to use an angle as buckets. So I
              replaced each 6 x 10 wood paddle with two pieces connected to each
              other to form an L shape.&nbsp;</font>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">I decided to use a 6 x 2 piece of
              wood that forms the bottom of each bucket and a 6 x 8 that forms

              3&quot; x 6&quot; will be used.</font>
              <p><font face="Verdana" size="2">This again showed an increase in

              That is why they are slanted. One problem that I noticed in this
