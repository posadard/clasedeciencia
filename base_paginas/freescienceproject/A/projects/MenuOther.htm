        <font face="Verdana" size="2">Following projects are among the project
        ideas that can be used as science project or as a hobby. Each project
        helps you to learn parts of a different science as well as new set of
        skills. We have not classified these projects for certain age or grade
        simply because you can review them yourself and decide which one is the
        best for you.</font>

          <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The effect of antenna design in
            collecting radio frequencies or electro magnetic waves.&nbsp;<br>
            In this project you will build a simple radio and investigate the
            effect of antenna shape, size and elevation on the amount of radio
            waves that you receive.<br>

          <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">Can you make electricity from
            fruits?<br>
            In this project you will attempt to see which fruits can be used to
            produce electricity. You will then test different fruits or fruit
            juice to see which one can produce more electricity. [Click here to

          <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">The effect of battery size on
            battery power.&nbsp;<br>
            Batteries are available in different sizes (AAA, AA, C, D). Does the
            size of a battery affect it's power? If we use a battery to turn on
            a small light bulb, do we get more light with a larger battery?<br>
            If we use a battery to activate an electric bell, does a larger
            battery result a louder sound? [Click here to see more details]<br>

          <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">How does an electric motor work?&nbsp;<br>
            In this project you can build an electric motor to get familiar with
            components and construction of an electric motor. You can then test
            different amounts of electricity to discover the effect of Electric
            Voltage on the speed or power of an electric motor. [Click here to

          <li><font face="Verdana" size="2">How does a kaleidoscope work?<br>
            Before invention of electric lights and television, Kaleidoscopes
            were popular form of visual entertainment. In this project you will
            make different models of kaleidoscope to produce ever-changing
            colorful images.<br>

            JavaScript is a programming language that can be processed in any
            computer with an updated browser. You can use any text editor such
            as notepad to type your program. This guide will show you how a
            simple game in JavaScript is being produced.&nbsp;<br>

            light to reveal invisible inks.</a><br>
            Verities of invisible inks are used in production of checks, bills
            and other valuable documents. Banks and consumers use Ultra Violet
            lights to reveal invisible inks and verify the authenticity of the
            document. In this project you will investigate to discover what
            household material can be used as invisible ink. </font></li>
